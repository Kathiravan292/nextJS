What is Next.js?
  Next.js is a React-based web framework that helps you build modern, fast, and SEO-friendly web applications easily.

The key features of Next.js:  
  🌟 1. File-based Routing
  ⚡ 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  
  🏗️ 3. Static Site Generation (SSG) 
  🔄 4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)  
  🧠 5. API Routes (Built-in Backend)
  🖼️ 6. Image Optimization
  🧭 7. App Router (New in Next.js 13+)  
  🧩 8. Layouts & Nested Routing 
  ⚙️ 9. Middleware

Routing Convenction:
  Next.js automatically creates routes based on your folder and file structure — no need for React Router.
  There are two routing systems you might use:
Basic Example:
  app/
 ├── page.js          →   /
 ├── about/
 │     └── page.js    →   /about
 ├── contact/
 │     └── page.js    →   /contact

🧭 Nested Routes in Next.js (App Router):
  In Next.js, folders inside the app/ directory automatically define nested routes.
  You don’t need React Router — everything is handled by file and folder structure.

app/
 ├── page.tsx                →  /
 ├── about/
 │    └── page.tsx           →  /about
 ├── products/
 │    ├── page.tsx           →  /products
 │    └── details/
 │         └── page.tsx      →  /products/details
 └── layout.tsx

Dynamic routes:
  In Next.js App Router, a dynamic route lets you create pages that respond to variable path segments in the URL.
app/
 ├── layout.tsx
 ├── page.tsx
 └── product/
     ├── [productId]/
     │   └── page.tsx


nested dynamic routes:
  n Next.js, nested dynamic routes let you create pages whose URLs depend on dynamic parameters — like /blog/[id]/comments/[commentId].
  app/
 └── blog/
      └── [id]/
           └── comments/
                └── [commentId]/
                     └── page.js
colocation:
  Colocation simply means keeping files that are related to a specific route inside the same folder as that route.

Instead of having separate global folders for components, styles, tests, etc.,
Next.js encourages you to place them right next to the route (co-located).

Example 1 — Normal Nested Route (Without Colocation):
app/
 ├── blog/
 │    ├── [id]/
 │    │    └── page.js
 │    └── page.js
 ├── components/
 │    └── Comment.js
 ├── styles/
 │    └── blog.css
 └── layout.js

Example 2 — With Colocation:
app/
 └── blog/
      ├── [id]/
      │    ├── page.js
      │    ├── Comment.js         ← component for this route
      │    ├── CommentForm.js     ← helper component
      │    ├── style.module.css   ← route-specific style
      │    └── data.js            ← API or data fetching file
      ├── page.js
      └── layout.js

What Is a “Private Folder” in Next.js?
  A private folder is any folder whose name starts with an underscore (_),
like this:

app/
 └── blog/
      ├── _components/
      └── page.js


👉 Next.js treats folders starting with _ as non-routable —
they are ignored by the routing system.


What Are Group Routes in Next.js?
  Group Routes let you organize your folder structure without affecting the URL.
  app/
 ├── (auth)/
 │    ├── layout.js
 │    ├── login/page.js
 │    └── register/page.js
 ├── (dashboard)/
 │    ├── layout.js
 │    ├── home/page.js
 │    └── settings/page.js
 └── layout.js
