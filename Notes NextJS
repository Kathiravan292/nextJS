What is Next.js?
  Next.js is a React-based web framework that helps you build modern, fast, and SEO-friendly web applications easily.

The key features of Next.js:
  🌟 1. File-based Routing
  ⚡ 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
  🏗️ 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)
  🔄 4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
  🧠 5. API Routes (Built-in Backend)
  🖼️ 6. Image Optimization
  🧭 7. App Router (New in Next.js 13+)
  🧩 8. Layouts & Nested Routing
  ⚙️ 9. Middleware

Routing Convenction:
  Next.js automatically creates routes based on your folder and file structure — no need for React Router.
  There are two routing systems you might use:
Basic Example:
  app/
 ├── page.js          →   /
 ├── about/
 │     └── page.js    →   /about
 ├── contact/
 │     └── page.js    →   /contact

🧭 Nested Routes in Next.js (App Router):
  In Next.js, folders inside the app/ directory automatically define nested routes.
  You don’t need React Router — everything is handled by file and folder structure.

app/
 ├── page.tsx                →  /
 ├── about/
 │    └── page.tsx           →  /about
 ├── products/
 │    ├── page.tsx           →  /products
 │    └── details/
 │         └── page.tsx      →  /products/details
 └── layout.tsx

Dynamic routes:
  In Next.js App Router, a dynamic route lets you create pages that respond to variable path segments in the URL.
app/
 ├── layout.tsx
 ├── page.tsx
 └── product/
     ├── [productId]/
     │   └── page.tsx


nested dynamic routes:
  n Next.js, nested dynamic routes let you create pages whose URLs depend on dynamic parameters — like /blog/[id]/comments/[commentId].
  app/
 └── blog/
      └── [id]/
           └── comments/
                └── [commentId]/
                     └── page.js
